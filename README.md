# SquaredTicTacToe

What is it? 
  
   This is a small two player game in which one needs to win TicTacToe games in a typical pattern in order to win the overall game.
   
How does it work?
  
  The game is divided in subgames and panels. The game has 9 subgames and each subgame contains 9 panels.
  At the start the first player clicking any panel they choose.
  The second player then needs to pick any panel in the subgame with the corresponding position of the panel which was chosen before.
  If one of the players happens to connect 3 panels in a subgame in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally, they "win" that subgame and is now "locked". 
  To keep track of the won subgames, the frames of the subgames are coloured in grey(open),blue or red 
  If one of the players now choose a panel corresponding to a "locked" subgame, the next player can choose out of any unlocked subgame.
  The goal is to win 3 subgames in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
  
Can i restart the game?
  
  There is no restart button in the game right now but you can restart by closing and restarting the programm.
